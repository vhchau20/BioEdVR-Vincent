# BioEdVR
Developed by Clair Ma, Lily Steiner, Vincent Chau\
Advised by Alex Shin, Jeanne Vu

## Description
BioEdVR serves as an educational VR application that allows users to interact
with a structural model of a human cell, including but not limited to the
nucleus, mitochondria, spindles, and centrioles. Our hope for this project
was to help foster a new era of biological education in which students and
scholars can interact with various types of biological systems
